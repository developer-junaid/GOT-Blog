                The first season of the fantasy drama television series Game of
                Thrones premiered on HBO on April 17, 2011, in the U.S. and
                concluded on June 19, 2011. It consists of ten episodes, each of
                approximately 55 minutes. The series is based on A Game of
                Thrones, the first novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by
                George R. R. Martin, adapted for television by David Benioff and
                D. B. Weiss. HBO had ordered a television pilot in November
                2008; filming began the following year. However, it was deemed
                unsatisfactory and later reshot with some roles recast. In March
                2010, HBO ordered the first season, which began filming in July
                2010, primarily in Belfast, Northern Ireland, with additional
                filming in Malta.</p>

                The story takes place in a fantasy world, primarily upon the
                continent Westeros, with one storyline occurring on another
                continent to the east, Essos. Like the novel, the season
                initially focuses on the family of nobleman Eddard "Ned" Stark,
                the Warden of the North, who is asked to become the King's Hand
                (chief advisor) to his longtime friend, King Robert Baratheon.
                Ned seeks to find out who murdered his predecessor, Jon Arryn.
                He uncovers dark secrets about the powerful Lannister family,
                which includes Robert's queen, Cersei, whom his predecessor died
                trying to expose. This leads, after Robert's death, to Ned's
                arrest for treason. Ned's eldest son, Robb, begins a rebellion
                against the Lannisters. Ned is killed at the order of Cersei's
                tyrannical teenage son, King Joffrey Baratheon. Meanwhile, in
                Essos, the exiled Viserys Targaryen, son of the former king,
                forces his sister Daenerys to marry a Dothraki warlord in
                exchange for an army to pursue his claim to the Iron Throne. The
                season ends with Viserys dead and Daenerys becoming the Mother
                of Dragons.

                Game of Thrones features a large ensemble cast, including

                Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Michelle Fairley, and Iain
                Glen. Newer actors were cast as the younger generation of
                characters, such as Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Sophie Turner,
                and Maisie Williams.</p>

                Critics praised the show's production values and cast;
                Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion Lannister received specific
                accolades, as did Bean and Clarke, as well as Ramin Djawadi for
                music.
